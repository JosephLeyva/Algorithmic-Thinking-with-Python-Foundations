## 100 Door Challenge

### *Problem Statement*

Imagine you have 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. You are going to make 100 passes by each of these doors. On the first pass, you are going to visit each door in sequence and toggle it state (if itâ€™s closed it becomes open and vice versa). For the second pass you visit every second door and toggle it state. For the third pass you visit every third door, and so on and so forth, until you only visit the 100th door on the 100th pass. Which doors are open and which are closed after the last pass?
