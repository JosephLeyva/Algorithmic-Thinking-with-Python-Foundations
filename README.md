## 100 Door Challenge

### *Problem Statement*

Imagine you have 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. You are going to make 100 passes by each of these doors. On the first pass, you are going to visit each door in sequence and toggle it state (if it’s closed it becomes open and vice versa). For the second pass you visit every second door and toggle it state. For the third pass you visit every third door, and so on and so forth, until you only visit the 100th door on the 100th pass. Which doors are open and which are closed after the last pass?

## The Fizz Buzz Coding Challenge

### *Problem Statement*

It’s a game for two or more players and you take it turns to count aloud from one to 100, but each time you are going to say a multiple of 3, replace it with the word **“fizz”**, and each time you are going to say a multiple of 5, you replace it with the word **“buzz”**, and for numbers which are multiple of both 3 and 5, you say **“fizzbuzz”**

### *Example*

```one, two, fizz, fout, buzz, fizz, seven, eight, fizz, ...```

## Brute Force Search

Many computational problems can be solved by trying all possible candidate solutions until the correct solution is found. This approach is often called exhaustive search or brute force search. Although clumsy and inefficient, a brute force version of an algorithm is often well worth trying to get a feel of the problem before attempting to implement a better solution.The reason a better solution is often needed is that for many problems, the brute force method takes an impractical amount of time.
